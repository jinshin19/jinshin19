# About Me:

- Hi! my name is Joshua and I'm currently studying web development. 
- I really interested in developing something such as this thats why I choose the path of web development. 
- But I never thought that this would become so very challenging, specially in my case because I'm studying alone in my house, watching some tutorials and putting it into action. But I feel stuck and I don't know ( maybe because of my comprehension is not that great).
- That's why I'm looking forward to collaborate to any <b>projects</b> out there that not can only help me <b>enchance my skill</b>, <b>learn new things</b>, <b>be efficient in coding</b>, <b>be more productive</b> and to be a helpful to others.
- I know, It would take me more years that's why I give up on rushing things and choose to get along with the process. Nice to meet ya!
